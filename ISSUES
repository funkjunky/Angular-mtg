A list of issues that I will solve later
---
- nice formatting
	soln: use bootstrap stuff to make every look ince and fit nicely.
- code is disorganized
	soln: put things in their own files and organize the structure
- currently the pool acts as a board in that if you remove one card, it's gone. I need it to act more intelligently. For sealed.
- no tests
	soln: write runners to test everything.
